# WHAT THE FUCK
Drawterm is a program that's kind of hard to describe. First, you need some computer history. Computers used to be all text. Then people wanted porn and mice. And Star Trek on GUIs. Computers became what they are now, and the Terminal morphed into a program. But it could have been different if the need for high-performance computing had outweighed the desire for a Personal Computer. Things like the BLIT for UNIX allowed PEOPLE to USE actual computers when personal computers were little more than expensive electronic typewriters. See, real computers back then were so big you needed a little desktop terminal that hooked into the phone and dialed the real computer. The BLIT extended these original text-based "dumb terminals" with special codes to draw GUI shit for the PEOPLE. DRAWTERM was created long after everyone lost interest, a program for a PERSONAL COMPUTER that emulated a MACHINE that NEVER EXISTED!!! dun da daaaaaaa...
